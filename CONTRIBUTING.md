# CONTRIBUTING #

### Please contribute!

We love collaboration. In fact, this was one of the main ideas to start the work on recapp. This includes bug reports, suggestions or even implementations of new features. Of course, you are also welcome to suggest general improvements to the package structure or to whatsoever. We appreciate any contribution and collaboration.

#### Code of Conduct

Please note that the **recapp** project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## How to contribute

### Ask a question :interrobang:

Browse the [documentation](https://ecomod-code.github.io/recapp/) to see if you can find a solution. Still stuck? Open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ecomod-code/recapp/issues) on GitHub. We'll try to do our best to address it, as questions often lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.

If you want to ask a question in private get in contact by [recapp-app@uni-goettingen.de](mailto:recapp-app@uni-goettingen.de).

### Propose an idea :bulb:

Take a look at the [documentation](https://ecomod-code.github.io/recapp/) and [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ecomod-code/recapp/issues) list to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, please open a new issue!

While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

### Report a bug :bug:

Report it as an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ecomod-code/recapp/issues) so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:

* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug
* A screenshot if possible
* Details like browser, operating system or anything about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.


### Improve the documentation :book:

Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!
